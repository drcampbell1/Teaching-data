## **Data Analysis for Social Science**<br/> **Ross Campbell, PhD** ##

This module introduces students to data analysis. It provides an introduction to the programming language R, using a powerful set of tools known as the Tidyverse. You'll learn to bring data into RStudio using the readr package and examine its properties and structure. You'll also learn how to filter, sort and summarise real datasets to answer exploratory questions using the dplyr package. Second, you'll turn this processed data into informative bar plots, histograms and line plots, and customise them with the ggplot2 package. Youâ€™ll get a taste of the value of exploratory data analysis and the power of Tidyverse tools.

### What technology will we use to do this? 

The software we'll be using is R and RStudio. You will need to download and install both on your computer before the live sessions. You can download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) and you can download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com). Both are free of charge. Simply download the version matching your operating system (Windows or Mac) and you're ready to go. R and RStudio are open-source programmes for analysing data and R is one of the leading programming languages. But you don't need to be a computer programmer to use it effectively. You'll learn to write code over the course of the module and gain practice refining and executing it.

### How will we do this? 

I have created a series of lessons on Moodle, which guide you through how to use R. These are short and designed to give you the key information in an accessible format. Once you've viewed the lesson, there will be interactive sessions where we complete exercises together. You will have the oppotunity to ask questions, learn more deeply and pick up tips for the assessments.

### What data will we use?

This course uses atwo datasets. The first is an abbreviated verison of the European Social Survey. The survey is too big to use in full, so I've reduced the number of countries and variables to make it more accessible. As you'll see when we look at the questions it asks, it is a really good data source for those interested in social science subjects. You can find out more about the European Social Survey [here](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/).

### Why are we using data?

This is not a course on statistics and students do not need to have mathematical skills to complete the lab exercises. But surveys frequently include data on forms of political participation, and this can provide helpful, but qualified, answers to the questions guiding this module. Most commonly, these surveys come in cross-national form; i.e., they are collected in multiple countries simultaneously. This enables us to examine and compare levels of participation in regions within countries, and/or across countries. In doing this, the data contradict your assumptions. The lesson here is to be cautious about approaching this module with assumptions. Not everything that you think is happening is *actually* happening. Let the data guide you, but be critical of it too. 


### Where can I get help with R/RStudio?


I hope this module find that you want to build your skills, there are lots of resources for using R and RStudio. All of the following are free of charge:

- Presentations on YouTube

  - How to install R and RStudio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RrkJQQYqY)
  
  - An introduction to R: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL0s1coNtRk)
  
  - An introduction to R and the Tidyverse (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtQfXY0lIzc)
- Books
  - Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (2017) *R for Data Science* O'Reilly. (https://r4ds.had.co.nz)

  - See also: free books via RStudio (https://rstudio.com/resources/books/).

- Blogs explaining the *Tidyverse*

### Can I run the analyses on my own?
Yes - practice makes perfect! These materials have been produced to develop your knowledge and you should feel free to enter the data environment when you want. This will help you understand more about participation than simply reading someone's evidence - and this is an important part of being a social scientist. For as interesting as books and articles are, you need to examine the evidence on your own at some point. And the skills and techniques you'll acquire in doing so will benefit you in the long-term.
