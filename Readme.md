### **Data Analysis for Social Science**<br/> **Ross Campbell, PhD** ###
In this module, you'll learn how to analyse data and extract meaningful insights from it. The module will introduce you to the R programming language through a powerful set of tools known as the Tidyverse. You'll begin by using the *readr* package to bring data into RStudio and examine its properties and structure. You'll then use the *dplyr* package to count, sort and arrange your data - and you'll build on this by using the group by and filter verbs to probe for deeper insights. You'll create informative bar plots, histograms and line plots with the *ggplot2* package, optimising the aesthetics and geoms to help you build insightful and accurate visualisations. From here, youâ€™ll develop your *ggplot2* skills and learn how to use facets to customise them further. Most importantly, though, as you progress in the module, you'll see how these tools may be used together, enabling you to wrangle, summarise and visualise your data in a few steps.

### What technology will we use to do this? 

The software we'll be using is R and RStudio. You will need to download and install both on your computer before the live sessions. You can download R [here](https://cran.r-project.org/) and you can download RStudio [here](https://www.rstudio.com). Both are free of charge. Simply download the version matching your operating system (Windows or Mac), install them and you're ready to go. 

R and RStudio are open-source programmes for analysing data and R is one of the leading programming languages. But you don't need to be a computer programmer to use it effectively. You'll learn to write code over the course of the module and gain practice refining and executing it.

### How will we do this? 

I have created a series of lessons on Moodle, which guide you through how to use R. These are short and designed to give you the key information in an accessible format. Once you've viewed the lesson, there will be interactive sessions where we complete exercises together. You will have the oppotunity to ask questions, learn more deeply and pick up tips for the assessments. You'll also have exercises to complete on your own.

### What data will we use?

This course uses two datasets. The first is an abbreviated verison of the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/). The survey is too big to use in full, so I've reduced the number of countries and variables to make it more accessible. It is a really good data source for those interested in social science subjects. The second is the [World Values Survey](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp). It has been around since the 1981, meaning that it is ideal for tracking change over time. Again, it is too big to use in full, so I've reduced the number of countries involved. I've provided a separate web page where you can find more details on the variables in the surveys. Please look at this carefully *before* you begin the interactive lab sessions.

### Where can I get help with R/RStudio?


I hope this module find that you want to build your skills, there are lots of resources for using R and RStudio. All of the following are free of charge:
